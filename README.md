### 🧩 what i do
i build full-stack things that don’t crash (most days).  
`Go`, `React`, `PostgreSQL`, and a bit of `GCP` chaos.  
on bad days, might touch python and rust.

### 💼 experience

**Saudh — full stack intern** *(may ’25 → present)*  
mall digitalisation platform with digital catalogues + admin panel.  
built with `Go`, `React`, `GCP`, and `Gemini AI`.  
learned a lot, while breaking prod.

**Allo Towers — full stack intern** *(jan ’25 → now)*  
telecom infra, google maps, and signal data.  
stack: `Go`, `React`, `TypeScript`, `Python(hate it)`, `GCP`.  
worked with 100k+ entries, optimised queries (8min → 30s, 93% faster).  
deployed everything on `GCP`, cut server cost by 78%.  
parcel APIs, tower planning, and lots of map zooming.

### 🚀 projects

**[GeoHunt](https://geohunt.vercel.app)** — ai-powered geography game  
built in 10 days, scaled in 3 months.  
1700+ users, 1500+ monthly visitors.  
lost the entire db once , cried and got it back.  
stack: `Express`, `React`, `PostgreSQL`, `Prisma`, `Gemini`.

**[vish.fyi](https://vish.fyi)** — my portfolio  
a home for 10+ projects i’ve built over time.  
nothing fancy, just works (mostly).
